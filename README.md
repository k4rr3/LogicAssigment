# LogicAssigment
This was a university project where we had to create a Sudoku SAT Solver based on the Optilog Framework. The project is able to solve any kind of sudoku with
techniques for the assignments on each cell, such as ALO(at least one value on each cell), EO (exactly one value is assigned to a cell) and AMO(at most one value on each cell).
If you want to test the program, you must have installed the Optilog Framework from this link https://ulog.udl.cat/software/
